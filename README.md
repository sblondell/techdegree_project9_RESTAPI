* The `seed` folder contains a starting set of data for the database in the form of a JSON file (`data.json`) and a collection of files (`context.js`, `database.js`, and `index.js`) that can be used to create your app's database and populate it with data (we'll explain how to do that below).
* The `nodemon.json` file configures the nodemon Node.js module, which we are using to run your REST API.

## Getting Started

```
First, install the project's dependencies using `npm`.
npm install


Second, start your MongoDB server.
mongod


Third, seed your MongoDB database with data.
npm run seed


Lastly, start the application.
npm start

To test the Express server, browse to the URL [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/).
```
